                configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
                eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
                eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
                value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added
                to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
                qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate
                was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device
                purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo
                ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
                available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online
                trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its
                trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of
                any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available
                from Appleâ€™s trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible
                devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
